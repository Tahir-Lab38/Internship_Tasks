# Task 1 – Exploring and Visualizing the Iris Dataset 🌸

## 🎯 Objective
The goal of this task is to explore and visualize the Iris dataset to understand the structure, distributions, and relationships between different flower features using data analysis and visualization tools.

---

## 📊 Dataset
- **Source**: Built-in Iris dataset from Seaborn
- **Features**:
  - sepal_length
  - sepal_width
  - petal_length
  - petal_width
  - species (target class)

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used
- Python (Google Colab)
- pandas
- seaborn
- matplotlib

---

## 📌 Key Steps Performed

1. **Loaded the dataset** using seaborn and pandas.
2. **Inspected the dataset**: shape, columns, `.head()`, `.info()`, `.describe()`
3. **Visualized the data**:
   - Scatter plot (petal_length vs petal_width colored by species)
   - Histograms of all features
   - Box plots to identify potential outliers

---

## 🔍 Key Insights

- **Petal length and width** show clear separation between species.
- **Sepal features** have overlapping distributions across species.
- Some outliers are present in sepal width.
- Setosa is clearly separated from Versicolor and Virginica, which show slight overlap.
