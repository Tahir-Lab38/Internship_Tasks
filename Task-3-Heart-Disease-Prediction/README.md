# 🫀 Task 3: Heart Disease Prediction

## 🎯 Objective
Predict whether a person is at risk of heart disease based on medical features.

---

## 📁 Dataset
- Source: UCI Heart Disease Dataset
- File: `heart.csv`
- 14 columns including:
  - age, sex, chest pain type (cp), cholesterol (chol), fasting blood sugar (fbs), heart rate (thalach), etc.
  - Target: `target` (0 = no heart disease, 1 = heart disease)

---

## 🧪 Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier

---

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- Confusion Matrix
- ROC-AUC
- Classification Report

---

## 📌 Key Findings
- Features like `cp`, `thalach`, and `oldpeak` are important predictors.
- Both models show good performance on the test set.
- ROC Curve confirms model reliability.

---

## 📚 Skills Applied
- Binary classification
- Model training and evaluation
- ROC-AUC interpretation
- Feature importance analysis

---

## ✅ Result
A working heart disease classifier that predicts with high accuracy and provides feature insights.
